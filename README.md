### Fetch Backend challenge

This is an excercise in building a webservice to fulfill a documented API described [here](https://github.com/fetch-rewards/receipt-processor-challenge/blob/main/README.md).

Dockerfile is included to provide a ready environment.

```
docker pull damann1072/fetch-backend
```

This API is also deployed to Vercel for easy access with Postman.

Endpoint: 
```
